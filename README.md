## I am Sundau Star, a Tommyinnit fictionkin (c! and cc!)!!

INTERACT UNLESS ON DNI 😋
I like myself

I like big butts and I cannot lie

- I am sunny, I am usually a hyper child as I do have autism and I often bring it up incase people forget since some have and said I'm annoying as I have stated I am diagnosed.
- remember, I am diagnosed, and energetic. if you do not want to deal with someone who has too much energy then just don't talk to me.
- I'm open for friends tho. but if we meet on ponytown and then proceeded to ignore each other even though were friends there I will remove you after a certain amount of time of not interacting.
- please do not hurt my feelings, I get attached easily and it's harder for me to let go
- I do not like it when I get ignored purposely. so please don't ignore me for too long, I would understand if you were busy but if you aren't, don't leave me out for too long, I get sad.
- if you see me, c+h PLEASE unless on dni of any variation.
- think of me like cat, with dog logic.
  
mansplain, manipulate, manwhores my way out of any of any mess/j💅

- might be verbal or non verbal so please pleaseI am paranoid, I see things that aren't there, not often but I'll tell you if I see them and I get scared because of them. I don't like them. sometimes I see things in the dark, like eyes, keep an eye out for these conversations. 
- do not bring up my past trauma. it's a simple boundary. do not until I say that I would like to talk about it.
- make sure I'm not on dni first before interacting, if on DND(on disc), you can still message me but I don't guarantee an answer.

- I believe blocking people doesn't do much. I believe that people should be respected and treated respectfully. I believe that blocking people just hides them from you and that is not ideal since you can't just hide your problems.

## more about me

as a Tommyinnit kinnie,I'd prefer if you used he-they pronouns. He more preferably and being known as a they would be quite nice but i do would like to bring up other personas.

- Tommy(yes, Tommyinnit), refer to me as Tommy if you would like to talk to me, or the fictionkin side.
- Sunny is a more feminine persona but prefers they-them pronouns. they're more so who I'd like to be referred as if you want to talk about my personal life rather than the fictionkin of c!Tommy as Tommy does tend to rather talk about canonical lore and/or generally yap about random stuff.
- Kale(yes, he is vegetable.) is more on the masculine side, often who I feel more associated with when I'm just feeling negative energy like sadness or just miss someone.
- Clover is all three combined, but when I'm age regressing. more childish and baby talks through text and speech.

this is different from being a system as I am not, this is more so for distinguishing what I feel at the moment, I just happened to give them a name so they would feel a bit more important to me. these four(expect Tommy as he is very recently named and formed bc of watching the British boy, I stole his personality hehehehehehehe) have been what I've been feeling all my life and I just now gave them names because it's kinda silly.
