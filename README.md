## I am Sunday Star!!

INTERACT UNLESS ON DNI ðŸ˜‹
I like myself

I like big butts and I cannot lie

- I am sunny, I am usually a hyper child as I do have autism and I often bring it up incase people forget since some have and said I'm annoying as I have stated I am diagnosed.
- remember, I am diagnosed, and energetic. if you do not want to deal with someone who has too much energy then just don't talk to me.
- I'm open for friends tho. but if we meet on ponytown and then proceeded to ignore each other even though were friends there I will remove you after a certain amount of time of not interacting.
- please do not hurt my feelings, I get attached easily and it's harder for me to let go
- I do not like it when I get ignored purposely. so please don't ignore me for too long, I would understand if you were busy but if you aren't, don't leave me out for too long, I get sad.
- if you see me, c+h is ok unless on dni of any variation.
- think of me like a cat, with a dog's brain. I might be verbal or non verbal so please int
- I am paranoid, I see things that aren't there, not often but I'll tell you if I see them and I get scared because of them. I don't like them. sometimes I see things in the dark, like eyes, keep an eye out for these conversations. 
- do not bring up my past trauma. it's a simple boundary. do not until I say that I would like to talk about it.
- make sure I'm not on dni first before interacting, if on DND(on disc), you can still message me but I don't guarantee an answer.
- I read on ao3 specifically, wattpad is for the weak.
  
- DNI PEDOS, WEIRDOS AND CREEPS!!
- I AM A MINOR.
